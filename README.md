## Overview
This is my own take to an markdown editor to help me automate writing cover letters. Made this using React.js and Marked.js. jsPDF was used to generate the markdown as a PDF. Still in Beta phase. 

## Features
You can add the business and role you're applying to and it'll auto populate to the letter. 


## Todo
* Fix PDF file bug
* Localstorage saving
* Make Responsive
* Testing

## Known Bugs
* Not able to auto populate role and jobs after editing markdown content
